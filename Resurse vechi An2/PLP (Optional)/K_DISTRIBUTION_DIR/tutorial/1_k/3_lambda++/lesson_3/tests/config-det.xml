<!-- The first program, omega, does not terminate.  The last two
     are excluded because they yield nondeterminism unless we kompile with the
     superstrict "strict" option, which is done in config2.xml.  We do not
     want to kompile with the superstrict "strict" option for all programs, 
     because it is too slow (we should check if it still is slow now).  -->
