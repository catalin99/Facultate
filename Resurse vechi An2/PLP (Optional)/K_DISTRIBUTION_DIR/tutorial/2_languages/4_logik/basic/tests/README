Run programs (from the parent directory) with the command:

  krun --search --pattern "<solution>M:Map</solution>" programs/pgm.logik

This will only show solutions when they exist.  If you also want to see
the entire configuration, for example when you want to know why it
failed to find a solution, then run it with the command

  krun --search programs/pgm.logik

But note that, in the latter case, a .Bag solution is always reported
whenever there is a possibility that unification may fail.
