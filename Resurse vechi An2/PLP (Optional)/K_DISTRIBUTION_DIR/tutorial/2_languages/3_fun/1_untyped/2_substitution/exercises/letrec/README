The current substitution-based definition of FUN allows only letrec
with one binding.  This exercise asks you to add letrec with
arbitrarily many bindings to substitution-based FUN.  If correctly
defined, all the programs that executed correctly with the
environment-based FUN should also execute correctly with your
new substitution-based definition of FUN (albeit probably more slowly).
