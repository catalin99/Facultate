A quine program written in K-framwork
by Radu Mereuta

A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its
own source code as its only output.

The idea for these examples has been taken from wiki page explaning this type
of programs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)

The explicit example follows the main idea on the wiki page where the program
is composed out of three main parts: prefix, strings, and suffix. Each line of
the program is also found in the strings part. The rules take each string line
and prints it once as a program line, and another time as a string, taking
care of the special characters that need to be escaped.

The short example has only one rule, and the string information is
concentrated into just a few (bigger) strings.
