Prim with heaps:
    make a heap of values (vertex,edge,weight(edge))
        initially (v,-,infinity) for each vertex
        let tree T be empty
    while (T has fewer than n vertices)
    {
        let (v,e,weight(e)) have the smallest weight in the heap
        remove (v,e,weight(e)) from the heap
        add v and e to T
        for each edge f=(u,v)
        if u is not already in T
            find value (u,g,weight(g)) in heap
            if weight(f) < weight(g)
            replace (u,g,weight(g)) with (u,f,weight(f))
    }
